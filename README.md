🚀 Machine Learning Journey

This repository documents my hands-on Machine Learning learning journey.
The goal is skill-building through implementation, not just theory or tutorials.

I am intentionally using GitHub to:
Practice real ML concepts
Build strong fundamentals
Track my progress over time
Create a portfolio that reflects job-ready skills

🧠 Learning Philosophy (Important)
This repository does NOT contain:
Random notes
Copy-pasted tutorials
Every topic I study
It ONLY contains: Implemented concepts, Experiments I understand, Code I can explain in interviews
If something is here, it means:
I studied it, implemented it, and learned from it.

📚 Topics Covered (Growing Over Time)
  1️⃣ Python for ML
  2️⃣ NumPy
  3️⃣ Pandas
  4️⃣ Data Visualization
  5️⃣ Machine Learning Algorithms
  6️⃣ Scikit-Learn Pipelines

🛠️ Projects (Quality > Quantity)



📈 Progress Tracking

This repository is continuously updated as I learn new concepts and improve existing ones.
Older code may look simpler — that’s intentional.
It shows growth, not perfection.

🎯 Goal
My objective is to become job-ready in Machine Learning, with:
Strong fundamentals
Clean code
Ability to explain decisions
Real-world thinking
This repo is a reflection of that journey.

⚠️ Disclaimer
This is a learning repository, not a production system.
Code quality improves over time as my understanding deepens.
